Andrew Conklin was born in Dayton, Ohio, and raised in a military family, moving frequently throughout his childhood. This constant change sparked his early interest in storytelling and visual media.</br></br>
In 2022, he moved to Atlanta to pursue a career in acting and film. Eager to immerse himself in the industry, Conklin often attended film events and sets-sometimes sneaking in-just to observe, network, and gain hands-on experience.</br></br>
In 2024, he co-founded Soleil Pictures with filmmaker Christopher Perez, a company dedicated to producing original narrative films.
